# Xolo Pipeline Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Xolo Pipeline**, a lightweight and modular pipeline framework for VFX and animation projects.

---

## What is Xolo?

Xolo Pipeline is designed for **freelancers, solo artists, and small studios**.  
Its goal is **not** to replicate large studio pipelines, but to provide a **practical, clean, and flexible foundation** that grows with your project:

- From a single artist working locally  
- To a small team sharing consistent tools, structure, and environments

This project is currently in **early alpha**, which means:

- Core features are functional  
- Some features are planned but not yet implemented  
- Breaking changes may happen  

---

## Current Focus

At this stage, Xolo provides:

- A **Python-based CLI** to launch supported DCCs in a controlled environment  
- Clear **project structure** with assets, shots, and configuration  
- **Environment management using `uv`**  
- **Centralized OCIO/ACES configuration**  
- Early **DCC integrations** for Blender and Gaffer (Nuke planned)
